They say they WON\u2019T CHARGE ME as long as I patch the holes. OK then I did some hanging and patched all the holes before moving out. TADA, they charge me $500 for wall painting!!! Even though holes are patched, they need to repaint the whole unit. What about the leasing office\u2019s initial promise? They replied \u201cWe are so sorry for the miscommunication\u201d.<br><br>2.

        "full_html": "Short version:<br>Living spaces and amenities are generally decent and fine. Management is incompetent, petty, and does not care at all about tenants.<br><br>Longer version:<br>I lived here with one roommate in a 2bed/2bath unit on a year long lease,  June 2020 - 2021. The first week we moved in, we noticed that the AC system was not working properly - air was not flowing into the master bedroom. We put in a maintenance request, after which management tried to convince us that nothing was actually wrong, this is just the way it's supposed to work. Since this response is clearly ridiculous, we asked that an external AC repair technician be brought in to take a look. Unsurprisingly, the technician identified in less than 10 minutes that the unit had a faulty motor that needed replacement. Revela then proceeded to take more than 5 months to get this repair done; nearly half the lease gone by without a basic feature that we pay rent for. When we asked management to provide some sort of compensation for this (keeping in mind the entirety of the summer months had passed by, peak AC usage season), they once again reverted to the stance that nothing was ever wrong with the AC and that the repair job was on us for asking for an upgrade to the unit. When we tried to escalate this complaint to regional management, they brushed it off and just said we're free to terminate the lease at any point if we want (and pay an additional 2 months rent as fee for doing so).<br><br>Some other reasons to avoid Revela specifically:<br><br>- Building fire alarms are constantly going off. Over the course of a year living here, the alarm was triggered at least 10 times, which forces you to leave the building because the siren is so loud. Revela management took no real steps to addressing this besides a few template mass emails, and actually even tried to shift the blame towards residents by stating that the front doors of units should not be used for helping to air out the kitchen.<br>- Indifferent attitude towards theft occurring on Revela property. My roommate had his bike stolen from the supposedly secure key-access bike room in the garage. Management took no action besides a bland \"apology\" email, and took several weeks more to access security footage from cameras in the garage.<br>- Terrible communication and responsiveness. The leasing office has stated hours of 9am-6pm most days, but good luck trying getting hold of a real person when needed. 4 out of 5 times I call the office (during business hours) no one answers, and half the time if you physically go to the office during the day no one is around. This could be written off as just unlucky on my part, since they claim to do leasing tours during the day and are sometimes unavailable, but this was my consistent experience from a full year of living there, so interpret that however you want. If you try to avoid this headache by utilizing email instead, you will still have difficulty. Unless you have a basic question or request that takes no effort to resolve, responses could take over a week to arrive (this was the case when trying to get our AC fixed). Completely ridiculous for people who are supposedly full-time \"community managers\".<br>- Unnecessary \"valet trash service\" fees. This is $50/month for someone to take bags from your door to the trash room down the hall. You can't opt out, even if you live next door to the trash room where it's actually faster and more convenient to just throw things out yourself. Plus, if you use the service and don't put your bin back inside the apartment in time, management threatens you with additional fees.",

        "full_html": "I have lived at the Revela apartments for a year and a half.  There are many \"luxury\" apartment communities in Mountain View - don't move here.<br><br>Over the course of my time here there have been numerous issues that remain unaddressed:<br><br>* Increasing number of aggressive/rude/loud guests and/or tenants.  There was an incident where I was walking my dog in front of the building a month ago and a woman pulled into two spaces very deliberately and double parked.  There were a large number of spaces available and it bothered me.  When I asked her if she really needed two spaces, the woman proceeded to tell me that she would \"knock me down\" and that I \"would live longer if I kept my mouth shut\".  I notified management and they never followed up.<br>On another incident there was a group of people who were very loudly going through the hallway - so much so that they could be very clearly heard even over my television.  They passed a second time as noisily as the first and I poked my head out my door to ask that they keep it down.  They responded with \"it's the f***ing weekend\".  Nice.<br>* Frequent loud fire alarms.  Prior to moving here if I had been notified of this I don't know that I would have taken it as seriously as it should be.  But once you move in, it becomes a very real inconvenience.  Ask yourself if several times a month you'd like a meeting interrupted by an extremely loud fire alarm blaring.  What if you're in the shower?  4am?  It doesn't matter.  It happens all the time and in a year and a half has never been due to an actual fire.  It is almost always someone opening their front door when they're cooking or someone smoking too near the building.  Many tenants choose not to exit their units now when these alarms go off.  Heard of alarm fatigue?  This is a significant safety concern as if there is in fact a real fire at some point, people may not take the alarm seriously anymore.  Management offers no solutions.<br>* Lazy management team.  This applies to the majority of the office staff.  I can't say how many times I've been told that a staff member doesn't know the answer to a question and needs to defer to the property manager.  Prepare for a very long wait if he happens to be on vacation.  If you email them with a concern expect a very dismissive reply.<br>* Noise.  Walls really are paper thin.  I constantly hear my upstairs neighbors arguing late at night or talking on the phone at the top of their voice on their balcony.<br>* Random people constantly following tenants into building.  We have a call system that is rarely used.  I've refused entry to a stranger only for my neighbor to allow the person in.<br>* Stranger walked into my apartment.  The lock system on the doors make it difficult to confirm the front door is locked from the inside.  If you attempt to turn the handle, the door will open whether it is locked or not.  Unfortunately, this meant that a stranger mistook my apartment for another's and walked right in.<br>Update: I have now paid thousands of dollars to be released from my lease contract.  Beware anyone planning on moving here.<br>I also identified construction damage to one of the countertops that the apartments are now stating they will charge me for if they are not able to remove.  I clearly demonstrated that a person is not capable of causing this damage and that it had to be a machine.  Because I missed it during my move-in inspection they are insisting I am liable for it.  Do not expect these people to do the decent thing if you have a problem here.  They do the bare minimum to rent out the apartments and couldn't care less after you move in.  Expect robotic, scripted responses if you have a problem.  Can't wait to leave!",

It\u2019s insane that this apartment has not fixed this issue yet and is totally unacceptable. You can scroll down the reviews and see this recurring issue since last year. It\u2019s unimaginable if you have kids or pets.<br><br>Edit 1: *Another fire alarm on 1/21/2021* in afternoon and this time during a work zoom call. Seriously this is just embarrassing and keeps getting better. This apartment management is quick to complain about you if there is a random noise from your home but yet won\u2019t fix this absurd alarm issue. Save yourself and avoid this place.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Apartments are very modern and the community is beautifully maintained. Been living here since October and my experience has been okay. Here are some pros and cons:<br><br>Pros:<br>1) The leasing process was smooth albeit some minor hiccups but the team is really good and they are quick to address concerns.<br>2) Apartments are relatively new and the premises are well maintained.<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Package delivery is horrendous and the worst I\u2019ve ever seen in an apartment complex which thrives to be modern. There are lockers present (paid) but so far my deliveries have either been at the lockers; in the floor at locker room; mailroom; or doorstep. For every delivery it\u2019s a constant struggle to figure out where your package would have been left. And good luck walking to the parcel room if you live far away from leasing office.<br>2) The location is pretty dead with major business all 2-3 miles away.<br>3) I read the reviews about alarms but it only happened once since I moved in here. The management did send an email next day about the alarm.<br>4) You will pretty much be locked with 1 key per lease. The key fobs can\u2019t be duplicated. I work at a hospital night shifts and have my girlfriend visiting on weekends and they wouldn\u2019t issue an extra key after talks with \u201chigher management\u201d. I had to start a new lease agreement for my girlfriend who lives 250 miles away so she can visit me on weekends. This is absurd and unacceptable.<br>5) I constantly hear upstairs and adjacent neighbors sometimes even during quiet hours. Not ideal if you have worked a long shift and just want to sleep.<br><br>To summarize, this apartment tries to solve issues by creating even more unneeded issues. So far my experience has been underwhelming when compared to other luxury rentals in Mountain View. I will keep updating this review during my stay.",

This area has free Wifi from WaveG with decent speeds so that you can seamlessly move around between the shared office space and the pool when the meetings get boring.<br>Secured underground parking is available and comes included in most apartments but any extra parking space is going to cost you a premium $200/month (the same as a lease for a small car). Locationwise it's very nice with quick access to main roads, VTA and many companies at a 5-10 min walk. The apartments themselves have great areas, heating/cooling, very silent washer/dryer/dishwasher.",

        "full_html": "Revela has a lot of potential but as of right now I am rating 2 stars. I may upgrade later if the situation improves... Since we moved here in December the fire alarm has gone off at least 8 times. It always seems to be a false alarm but I have two dogs and I am not going to take any chances when it comes to their safety. The alarm is very loud and scares the dogs and has disrupted several important meetings we were trying to attend from home. Today the fire alarm went off again. I am recovering from surgery and walking the dogs down 4 flights of stairs while they are afraid of the loud alarm was a terrible experience, especially at a time when I need to be resting. After the fire department showed up and cleared the building I went back inside and the alarm went off yet again. The constant alarms are very disruptive and concerning.<br><br>The other issue is the construction next door. Whatever they are doing leaves a terrible odor in the air, it almost smells like something is burning but constantly for several months now. My partner who has never had allergies or breathing issues in the past has developed lung pain and trouble breathing since we moved here. We are certain that the construction is causing the issue and can't wait for it to be completed. For now we are running several air purifiers in the apartment to clean the air and wearing masks when we walk the dogs in the afternoon.<br><br>It's a shame to have to give Revela 2 stars because the building is very beautiful and the amenities are great. The complex hosts themed gatherings every month or so where they cater food and it creates a great opportunity to get to know our neighbors. I love that Revela does this! The staff in the office are great, very friendly, especially Lilly! I would love to be able to increase my rating in the future if the alarm situation is handled properly. When we first moved in we loved going for walks along the paths around the building, but the construction dust and terrible burning smell has ruined that recently. I can't wait for that portion of the construction to be finished.",
